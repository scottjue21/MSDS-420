# OnMart Superstore Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from OnMart, an online superstore with a business model similar to Amazon, Walmart, and Target. OnMart operates across several departments, offering products in categories such as Electronics, Clothing, Grocery, Furniture, and Sports. With a comprehensive logistics network involving warehouses and distribution centers, OnMart delivers orders to customers across multiple zip codes in the U.S. This analysis leverages SQL and Python to evaluate sales trends, customer behaviors, and supply chain efficiencies, providing insights that can drive OnMart’s business strategy and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Analysis Objectives
This analysis addresses several key areas of OnMart’s operations, focusing on customer behavior, sales performance, and supply chain logistics. Through SQL and Python analysis, the following objectives were pursued:

- **Return Analysis**: Understanding product return patterns is essential to manage inventory and improve customer experience. We analyzed data on product returns by delivery zip code and product category to identify which regions and types of products have the highest return rates. This insight helps OnMart manage high-return categories and address customer pain points.

- **Sales Performance Evaluation**: By calculating total sales per zip code, we were able to pinpoint areas with the highest revenue and identify top-performing product categories. Additionally, we used boxplots to visualize the distribution of sales across zip codes and product categories, providing an understanding of revenue variability in different regions and departments. Scatter plots further highlighted yearly sales trends in key zip codes for popular product categories, allowing us to observe how demand evolved over time.

- **Customer Purchase Trends**: We analyzed order data by product category, home zip code, and month to uncover seasonal or location-specific demand trends. By capturing these patterns, OnMart can adjust stock levels and marketing strategies to better meet customer demand across different regions and times of the year.

- **Delivery Efficiency in Supply Chain**: To assess logistical performance, we examined delivery delays by distribution center, identifying the locations with the most significant delay challenges. This analysis highlights areas where logistics improvements could enhance customer satisfaction.

- **Influential Reviewers**: To gauge the influence of customer engagement on product perception, we identified the most influential reviewers for each product. By analyzing customer reviews, ratings, and social network interactions, we highlighted customers who could serve as key brand advocates. Understanding these influencers helps OnMart refine its marketing approach and encourage positive product recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL (Postgres)**: Data retrieval and manipulation
- **Python (pandas, seaborn, psycopg2)**: Data processing, analysis, and visualization

## Conclusion
Through this data-driven analysis, we uncovered meaningful insights into OnMart’s operational performance and customer interactions. Key findings include pinpointing high-return product categories, recognizing top-performing and low-performing sales regions, identifying seasonal demand patterns, and understanding customer delivery experiences. These insights can support strategic decisions to enhance OnMart’s inventory management, sales strategy, and logistics, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
